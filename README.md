# AdventOfCode2020.jl

Julia Package with my attempt at [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).
Just for fun and for learning Julia.

The setup is heavily inspired by [goggle/AdventOfCode2020](https://github.com/goggle/AdventOfCode2020.jl).

## Overview
The commits with the first submitted correct solutions for each day are tagged
with git tags. `v0.1` for day 1, `v0.2` for day 2 etc.
